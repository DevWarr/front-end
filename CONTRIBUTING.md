# Contributing to RVZ

We are excited that you want to help make this game better! Thank you!

## Guidelines

1. Clone the repo, make your changes on a branch with your name on it (e.g. jane-smith), then make a pull request. I will be looking at pull requests in the early afternoon. If everything looks good, I will merge it. Otherwise I'll review it with some comments on things that need to be fixed.

2. Don't change the Prettier settings. We want the code to look beautiful and consistent.

3. Explain what you did in your PR and explain why you think they will benefit the project.
