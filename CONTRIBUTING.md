# Contributing to RVZ

We are excited that you want to help make this game better! Thank you!

## Guidelines

1. Fork the repo, make your changes, then make a pull request. I will be looking at pull requests in the early afternoon. If everything looks good, I will merge it. Otherwise I'll review it with some comments on things that need to be fixed.

2. Please use Prettier, and don't change the Prettier settings. We want the code to look beautiful and consistent.

3. Make sure to pull the latest changes to the project before you submit your pull request.

4. Explain what you did in your PR and explain why you think they will benefit the project.
